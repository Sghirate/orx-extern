/** @file nv_event.h
Contains a framework for event loop-based applications.  This library replaces
most or all of the normally-required JNI code for Android NDK applications,
presenting the application developer with two callbacks into which they can
write their application.  The framework runs in a natively-created thread,
allowing the application to implement a classic "event loop and render" structure
without having to return to Java code to avoid ANR warnings.  The library 
includes support for input and system event passing as well as JNI initialization
and exposes basic EGL functionality to native as well.  Put together, the library
can form the basis of a simple interactive 3D application.  All applications that
are based on this library must also be subclassed on the Java side from the
provided NvEventQueueActivity.  Additional external documentation on the use of
this library, the related Java code and the tool provided to create a template
application based on the library are provided with the SDK.
